These files are what we used and created during the Mash-Up events.

The Character Game was what we made, though different groups might have done it differently.
The two "pages" of that game usually go in different tabs for organization purposes, but they don't have to.

The shapes pages are examples of how to create different kinds of shapes in Processing.

The Character Starter was the program we used to make our characters - it has the built-in grid lines and can be easily transferred to the Character Game.

Processing is free and easy to download: https://processing.org/download
Their site has a lot of useful information and guides to get started: https://hello.processing.org/editor/

Every program you write builds skills and experience. Every act of creation comes more naturally than the last. The greatest achievements are built on hundreds of experiments, so start experimenting.
